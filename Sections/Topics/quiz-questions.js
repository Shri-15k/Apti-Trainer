      "OptionB": "95 meters",
      "OptionC": "100 meters",
      "OptionD": "105 meters",
      "Answer": "A",
      "Solution": "Let the length of the train be x meters. Relative speed = (54 - 6) \/ 18 m\/s = 48 \/ 18 m\/s. Solving this equation, we can find x = 90 meters. So, the correct option is a) 90 meters.",

      "OptionB": "250 meters",
      "OptionC": "300 meters",
      "OptionD": "350 meters",
      "Answer": "B",
      "Solution": "Let the length of the pole be x meters. Length of the bridge = 2x meters. Speed of the train when crossing the pole = x \/ 15 m\/s. Speed of the train when crossing the bridge = 2x \/ 24 m\/s. Since speed = distance \/ time, we have x \/ 15 = 2x \/ 24. Solving this equation, we get x = 125, and the length of the bridge will be 2x = 250 meters. So, the correct option is b) 250 meters.",
